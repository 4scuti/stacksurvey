# stacksurvey

**stacksurvey** is an exploration and analysis of data from StackOverflow's developer survey of 2024.

[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/)

The motivation for project is satisfying a class assignment. Eventually, an interesting (enough) topic was discovered in the data set: 

What is the annual compensation (y) over years of experience (x) of deveopers who use a programming language from a specific country?

## Requirements

    numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn

## Summary of Analysis

*For the purpose of this analysis, (data) scientists and researchers are also considered developers.*

The models generated by the notebook become less reliable for incomes greater than $200,000 per year and years of experience after 10.
